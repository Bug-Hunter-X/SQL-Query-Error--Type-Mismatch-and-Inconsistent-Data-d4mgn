```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales' AND salary > 100000;
```
This SQL query might encounter an error if the `salary` column is not of a numeric data type (e.g., it's a string or text type).  The comparison `salary > 100000` would then fail, possibly throwing a type mismatch error.

Another potential issue is if the `department` column contains inconsistent capitalization or extra spaces.  For instance, if some entries have 'sales', 'Sales ', or 'SALES', the query might miss some records unless the query uses a case-insensitive comparison (e.g., using `ILIKE` in PostgreSQL or `LOWER()` function in other databases).
