This repository demonstrates a common SQL query error arising from data type mismatches and inconsistencies in data entries within the database. The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous SQL query, which fails when the `salary` column isn't numeric or the `department` column has inconsistent capitalization. The `bugSolution.sql` file offers a corrected version addressing these issues.
